# Tabletop-Data-Researcher-and-Dice-Roller-
An application for Dungeons and Dragons' players for quick lookup on game properties and to handle in game math.

Both dice.cpp and main.cpp can be run as they both will give the same outputs. However, main.cpp will output the result along with the amount of time the request took.

To run, use the g++ compiler:

g++ main.cpp
./a.out

This will start the program in the terminal. 

To do a normal dice roll with a d20, you may type "d20" or simply press enter.
For math, the system does not follow the order of operations but instead runs from left to right in normal order. The calculator only supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It does not support parathenesis and exponents.

To find a spell, type in the name of the spell it will display the information. If it is spelled incorrectly, then you will recieve an error message.

To find a creature, type in "!" then the name of the creature, do not add a space inbetween the name and the "!".
